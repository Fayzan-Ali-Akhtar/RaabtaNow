Meta (formerly Facebook) envisions a future "to give people the power to build community and 
bring the world closer together." It values rapid innovation, long-term thinking, bold building,
and global connectivity. Meta’s work culture is dynamic, flexible, and impact-driven, with a 
strong emphasis on engineering and scaling solutions quickly. Operating in industries like social 
media, advertising, and virtual/augmented reality, Meta’s major achievements include the creation 
of Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp — some of the most widely used platforms globally — and being 
a leading force in the development of the Metaverse.
