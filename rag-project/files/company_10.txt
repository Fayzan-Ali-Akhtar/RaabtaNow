Salesforce seeks "to bring companies and customers together" and is driven by core values like trust,
customer success, innovation, and equality. The work culture at Salesforce emphasizes collaboration,
support, community service, and professional growth, strongly rooted in the "Ohana" spirit — 
meaning family in Hawaiian. As a pioneer in cloud computing and SaaS, Salesforce’s major 
achievements include creating the world’s leading CRM platform, leading the global transition to 
cloud-first software models, and being consistently recognized as one of the best places to work.
